    Thread t0 = new Thread(sd::syncMethod1);
    Thread t1 = new Thread(sd::syncMethod2);
    Thread t2 = new Thread(sd::syncBlock);
    Thread t3 = new Thread(sd::syncNone);
    Thread t4 = new Thread(SynchronizedDemo::syncStatic);
    Thread t5 = new Thread(SynchronizedDemo::syncStatic);

    t0.start();
    t1.start();
    t2.start();
    t3.start();
    t4.start();
    t5.start();
